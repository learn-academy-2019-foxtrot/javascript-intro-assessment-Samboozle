# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a chunk of code that executes when called. Functions are useful under circumstances when code needn't be executed on program startup but may be called under certain conditions (e.g., functions can be tied to on-click events in a browser window).

  Researched answer: from tutorialspoint.com's computer programming tutorial: "A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing."


2. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: .join() joins array items into a string; .concat() connects two or more arrays; .pop() removes the value at the last index; .push() appends an value to an array; .shift() removes the first value in an array

  Researched answer: additionally: .unshift() adds a value at index [0], incrementing all other values' indeces; splice() adds and removes values, and can return a new array with values removed from the parent array; slice() displays a new array with a parent array's values in a range of indeces; toString() can turn an array into a string (and can do the same for other non-string objects); .sort() orders array values by alphanumeric hierarchy



3. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console.log() displays a value to the console whereas return cements a value internally (as a property of a function, for example).

  Researched answer: from a somewhat helpful stackoverflow answer on this topic:

"Actually there's nothing in common between them.
return - returns execution to the caller with optional result
console.log() - logs out information in console."


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: an argument is value that can be passed to a function based on the function's parameter definition. A variable is a value-container that can be defined and stored in various scopes and only pertains to function arguments when called as function arguments. (funcions with don't necessarily need variables; values can be passed in directly in the function call, e.g, function('this non-variable string is being passed to the function'))

  Researched answer: from w3schools(various locations) variables: JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values; arguments vs parameters distinction: "Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function."


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Driver types while navigator dictates and oversees typing. Polite exchanges between two partners makes for quick, clean coding.

  Researched answer: From LEARNAcademy's syllabus (paraphrased): Driver uses keyboard & mouse, managing the editor; navigator watches and advises, offering the bulk of the high-level input.



6. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  Your answer: Javascript is a language that allows humans to speak to computers in a way that is negotiable for both sides.


7. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: I enjoy pair programming quite a lot! I enjoy the push-and-pull of teaching and learning collaboratively while creating a program.
